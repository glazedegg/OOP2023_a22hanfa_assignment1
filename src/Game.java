/*
 * Your assignment is to write a console application where the user plays “Lucky Card” game. 
 * This is a simple game, where a card deck is shuffled and then placed in a heap. Each card has a value computed as follows:   
 * value of the card + bonus of the card, where the bonus is 4 for diamonds, 6 for clubs, 8 for hearts and 10 for spades. 
 * In each round of the game, you draw three cards in sequence from the top of the deck. 
 * If the third card’s value is between the first two card values, then you win! 
 * If the third card is equal to either of the first two cards, or is outside of the set of values between the first two card values, then you lose!
